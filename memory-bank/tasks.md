## Status
- [x] Initialization complete
- [x] Implementation complete  
- [x] Reflection complete
- [x] Archiving

## Task Details

### Recently Completed
- [X] [Level 1] Fix: Streamlit warnings when running main.py directly (Completed: 2025-06-19)

## Reflection Highlights
- **What Went Well**: Multi-layered environment detection solution, clean user experience, comprehensive testing
- **Challenges**: Context detection complexity, initial approach limitations  
- **Lessons Learned**: Import timing matters for environment detection, multiple detection vectors provide robustness
- **Next Steps**: Monitor detection reliability, collect user feedback, consider performance implications

## Completed Enhancements
- [X] [Level 2] Enhanced: Added comprehensive Git commit template to README.md (Completed: 2025-06-19)
  - **Enhancement**: Added Git commit standards with conventional commit format
  - **Files changed**: README.md, .gitmessage
  - **Features**: Commit types, scopes, examples, setup instructions, quick commands
  - **Configuration**: Project-level Git template setup

## Completed Bug Fixes
- [X] [Level 1] Fixed: Streamlit warnings when running main.py directly (Completed: 2025-06-19)
  - **Issue**: When running `python main.py` directly, Streamlit showed warnings about missing ScriptRunContext and attempted to run in headless mode
  - **Solution**: Implemented proper Streamlit context detection using sys.argv, environment variables, and call stack inspection instead of importing Streamlit modules directly
  - **Files changed**: main.py
  - **Testing**: ✅ Verified no warnings when running `python main.py` directly, ✅ Verified Streamlit interface still works with `uv run streamlit run main.py`
  - **Result**: Clean fallback to CLI mode with helpful user guidance
  - **Reflection**: ✅ Complete - Documented insights and improvements for future work   - **Archive**: ✅ Complete - Task archived at memory-bank/archive/archive-streamlit-detection-fix-20250619.md
