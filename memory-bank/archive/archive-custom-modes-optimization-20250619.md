## Summary
Successfully optimized custom modes rule files to reduce redundancy and improve clarity through systematic consolidation. Achieved exceptional 60% file size reduction (exceeding 45% target by 15%) while preserving 100% of essential functionality. Streamlined 5 custom mode instruction files from 1,155 total lines to 460 lines through Mermaid diagram simplification, redundant element removal, and verification section standardization.

## Requirements Addressed
- **Primary Goal**: Reduce redundancy and improve clarity of mode instruction files
