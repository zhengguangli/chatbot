# TASK ARCHIVE: Streamlit Environment Detection Fix

**Archive ID**: archive-streamlit-detection-fix-20250619
**Task Type**: Level 1 (Quick Bug Fix)
**Project**: Chinese Chatbot v2.0
**Completed Date**: 2025-06-19

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Successfully resolved Streamlit environment detection issue that caused warning messages when running 'python main.py' directly. Implemented intelligent multi-layer detection system that properly distinguishes between direct Python execution and Streamlit runtime environment, eliminating user confusion while maintaining full functionality.

**Key Achievement**: Zero-warning execution with clean CLI fallback and preserved web interface functionality.

## TECHNICAL SOLUTION

Created is_streamlit_context() function with three detection methods:
1. Command line argument analysis (sys.argv)
2. Environment variable checking (STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT)
3. Call stack inspection for Streamlit presence

## TESTING & VALIDATION

✅ Direct Python execution: Clean CLI startup, no warnings
✅ Streamlit execution: Proper web interface launch
✅ Functionality: Both CLI and web interfaces work correctly
✅ User experience: Clear guidance for proper execution

## TASK STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED & ARCHIVED

Files Modified: main.py
Time Investment: ~20 minutes
Quality Score: High (complete problem resolution)
