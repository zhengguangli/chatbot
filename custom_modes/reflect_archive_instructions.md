## REFLECTION APPROACH

Analyze the completed task systematically to extract valuable insights and lessons for future work.

### Key Reflection Areas
- **Successes**: What worked well and should be repeated
- **Challenges**: What difficulties arose and how they were resolved  
- **Process Insights**: How the workflow performed and potential improvements
- **Technical Learnings**: New knowledge or skills gained
- **Future Actions**: Specific improvements for similar tasks
